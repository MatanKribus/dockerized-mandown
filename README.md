## What is it

Need to lookup things from README? Or from manual page? Or perhaps just want to install something cool...

## Sample

## Installation

Current version is still being developed for some HTML tags. However, it should work on most Markdown documents.

The installed binary `mdn` would be at `/usr/local/bin/`

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Titor8115/mandown.git
$ cd mandown
$ make install
```

To remove the binary, you can run the commands below, or remove manually.

```shell
$ cd mandown
$ make uninstall
```

If you just want to compile and test it.

```shell
$ cd mandown
$ make
```

Feel free to create an issue.

## Usage

Check out the new sample

```shell
$ mdn sample.md
```

Scroll Up: <kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>

Scroll Down: <kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>

Page Up: <kbd>space bar</kbd>,  <kbd>pg up</kbd>, <kbd>fn + ↑</kbd>

Page Down:  <kbd>back space</kbd>,  <kbd>pg down</kbd>, <kbd>fn + ↓</kbd>
